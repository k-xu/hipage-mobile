        <div id="interests"><h1>Interests and Visions</h1><p>Born in Shanghai, China, Kendra grew up in sunny island Singapore and is currently pursuing her passion for the arts in the United States. Her work focuses on social perception, psychological states, language and communication, as well as mankind's relationship with technology, especially when it comes to thought experiments about a hypothetical future. In her spare time, Kendra reads about psychology and the universe, plays musical instruments badly, draws or writes freely to capture her thoughts, and hopes to author meaningful books some day. Through design, she hopes to play a part in shaping the future of social exchange and information navigation in an increasingly connected yet divisive world.</p></div>
